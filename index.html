            <span>My Experience:</span><br>
            I'm a business professional with extensive sales operations and business development experience. I take a hands on approach to solve issues, drive efficiency, and develop strong sales organizations. Some of my greatest strengths include building long term strategic partnerships and establishing rapport with industry professionals. With a diverse background that ranges from owning my own business to leading startups to growth, I've gained a wide range of skills that have evolved over time. 
            </p>
     
            <p>
            I've spent the last several years at the world's largest startup building out processes and growing ad revenues to generate over $40M per week. As a trusted advisor, partner integration expert, and platform administrator, I've built strong relationships that lead to long term, repeat business and successfully on-boarded 1,000's of partners across various industries. 
            </p>

            <p>
            My current path has led me to dig deeper into technologies which support the businesses I've been involved with for many years. I'm studying to become a Full Stack Web Developer through a program offered at the University of Oregon. I'm becoming fluent in several new languages, such as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, node.js, as well as working with APIs. The goal is to better understand these programs and technologies and how they relate to driving or supporting business needs, while increasing the value that I bring to the table. I'm ready to build more amazing things!

            <span>My Journey:</span><br>
            From a very early age I realized I loved being in business. When I was young, I used to climb up in the walnut trees around the park and cut down mistletoe. I would break it into small batches and tie red ribbon around the stems, then package it, and sell it door to door around the neighborhood. It was a great way to raise funds for buying holiday gifts or adding to my candy supply. 
            </p>

            <p>
            As I enterd college I already knew I wanted to major in business. The world was big and I was thinking big so studying International Business seemed like the only logical choice for me. After college I found myself working for one of the biggest international food distributors in California, in what I thought was the best career ever. I was selling gourmet food and specialty items to grocery stores, restaurants, and bakeries. I relocated often, up and down the state, and truly enjoyed helping the customers I interacted with build their businesses by offering them my products and service.      
            </p>
    
            <p>
            When I made it to San Jose, I took a chance and applied to a little startup called Yahoo. As employee #2095 I spent many years there leading teams and driving successful products. I'm often told that I'm an awesome teammate, great business partner, and being the reason an organization stands out within the company.
