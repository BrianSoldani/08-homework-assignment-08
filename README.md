# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials

## Description
This assignment was to update my portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer competitive. Now that I've had some exposure to APIs and have a project to share, I've gone through my previous portfolio assignment to update it with better quality projects. The portfolio showcases these technologies being used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and APIs. 

### Project Details
Using the above mentioned technologies and my own previously deployed code sources, I've updated my portfolio along with other professional materials. The deployed application includes an updated resume with Full Stack Web Development skills, an updated Github profile, and an updated LinkedIn profile. The application consists of the following:

- Professional Bio.
- Updated "About Me" section.
- Revised Portfolio page highlighting my team Project.
- Exemplary class assignments included with my Project.
- Button links for my contact information and resume.
- Revised Resume including Full Stack Web Development experience.
- Mobile first design. 
- Cool and professional color pallet.
- Easy to read content and format with clear methods of contact and communication.
 
 ### Results
 The final application performs well and meets the requirements given above. I've chosen a modular build that will be easy to maintain and update as new assignments are completed and ready to show off for potential employers.
